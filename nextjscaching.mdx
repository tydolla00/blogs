If you're new to React & NextJS like I was, you're probably overwhelmed with
all the incredible features it has to offer. Next 13 introduces the App Router,
a revolutionary way of working with Server Side Rendering.
It brings a myriad of brand new features including support for React Server Components, the React teams’ brand new invention!

<InfoBlock type="info">
  React Server Components are their own complex jenga game to understand.
  They're out of the scope of this blog, however Josh Comeau, a **very**
  experienced React dev wrote an amazing <BlueLink
    href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/"
    text="blog post"
  /> about it!
</InfoBlock>

In short, React Server Components are components that run exclusively on the
server (…sort of). Which means you are able to directly access your backend system,
such as databases, file systems, and much more. It gives you the ability to write
backend code in React components and send fully hydrated HTML to the client.

Today we're talking about caching though. What is caching, how does it work in React, Next, and much more.

<H1 id="caching" text="What is Caching?" />

In order to understand caching, let's take a look at this graphic (without caching).

<GroceryGraphic />

<H2 id="truecaching" text="So how does it truly work?" />

When we make a request to an endpoint, we check our cache to see if the result
is stored in memory. On the first request this will be a <CodeBlock>`cache miss`</CodeBlock>. After
receiving the response, the response will be stored in memory (cached). Subsequent
requests to the same endpoint will be a <CodeBlock>`cache hit`</CodeBlock> and will never hit
the endpoint.

There are four key points of caching in Next.

<BulletList
  list={[
    "Request Memoization",
    "Data Cache",
    "Full Route Cache",
    "Router Cache",
  ]}
/>

Let's talk about Request Memoization.

<H2 id="request" text="Request Memoization" />

Request Memoization often referred to as deduplication, occurs when making
requests to the same endpoint. Using the native fetch api, requests hitting
the same endpoint will be cached and served from the cache.

<Example>
  You want to fetch the same data on two different pages. Without caching you
  would have to fetch the same data **twice** which is not very efficient. With
  request memoization we're able to cache & store that result in memory and any
  subsequent call will hit our cache instead of our endpoint. Let's take a look
  at a diagram from Vercel.
</Example>

<CustomImage src="requestmemoization.png" alt="Request Memoization" />

The first request is a <CodeBlock>`cache miss`</CodeBlock> because
there are none stored in memory. In the response the request is **set**
(stored in memory) and sent to the client. Now everytime we reach
the <CodeBlock>`item/1`</CodeBlock>
endpoint, it is a <CodeBlock>`cache hit`</CodeBlock>. Now the data cache is never
hit, reducing the load on the server and database.

What does this look like in code?

<Code lang="jsx">
```jsx
GET(request: NextRequest){
  // fetch user from database. 
  console.log("Users fetched.")
  // return user;
}

const getUsers = async () => {
const res = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/test");
return res.json();
};

export default async function TestPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Test />
      <SecondTest />
    </>

);
}

const Test = async () => {
  const users: user[] = await getUsers();
  return (<>...</>);
};

const SecondTest = async () => {
  const users: user[] = await getUsers();
  return (<>...</>); 
};
```
</Code>

How many times do you think "Users fetched" will be printed to the console?
<br/>
"1"
<br/>
Thanks to deduplication our database is only queried once. Every time 
getUsers is called data will be served from the data store (more about that later.).
<br/>
What if we can't always use the fetch API? In some scenarios you may want to fetch data
on the client, query the db directly via an ORM, or make use of server actions. This
is where React's <CodeBlock>cache</CodeBlock> function comes in.

const getUsersCached = cache(async () => {
  // Query DB directly and return users

  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  console.log("Users fetched.");
  return users;
});

export default async function TestPage() {
  const users: user[] = await getUsersCached();
  return (
    <>
      <Test />
      <SecondTest />
    </>
  );
}

const Test = async () => {
const users: user[] = await getUsers();
  return (<>...</>);
};

const SecondTest = async () => {
  const users: user[] = await getUsersCached();
  return (<>...</>); 
};

```
How many times do you think Users fetched will be printed in the console?

"2"
<br/>
You might think "Users fetched." would be logged only once. However getUsers and
getUsersCached are two different functions and therefore exist separately
in memory. Even though they both return users, they're entirely
different functions and execute once each time they are called.
<br/>
These functions are now deduped, meaning if we call getUsers or getUsersCached again,
we will not query our database. <BlueLink href="https://react.dev/reference/react/cache" text="Read more about React's cache function."/>

<InfoBlock type="warning">
Cache functions behave differently than the fetch API. 

*'React will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request.'*
<br/>
This means that if you refresh the page, you would see "Users fetched." 
in the log from the getUsersCached function and not from the api route. This is because
the cache is **not** persisted across requests.
</InfoBlock>

<H2 id="datacache" text="Data Cache" />

The Data Cache works hand and hand with Request Memoization. A request is 
made to an endpoint. On the first initial request it misses the cache. In 
the response it sets the data cache and memoizes the request. Now on every 
subsequent call, the request will *hit* and return data from the data cache. (This could be a problem for invalid data.)

You can opt out of caching if your data changes frequently. Such as apps 
like a Flight Tracker, food reservation, etc.
<BlueLink href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache"
text="Next provides many ways to invalidate data."/> Take a look at the diagrams 
below for a brief overview of how invalidating works.

Next Docs has amazing info about the full route cache and router cache. If you want me to go over these in detail contact me and if I get enough requests I will update the section.
